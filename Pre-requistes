This script has various dependencies as mentioned below. Make sure you have these setup before you set the code on your system. 

1. Python 3.6+ 
2. Telegram Bot
3. Task Scheduler

For python installation, follow this guide to install the most popular distribution package, Anaconda: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/

For creating Telegram Bot, follow the instructions as mentioned in this Medium Article. https://medium.com/@ManHay_Hong/how-to-create-a-telegram-bot-and-send-messages-with-python-4cf314d9fa3e

To get ChatID after creating the bot, search the bot and send "/start" to the bot. 
Post that, go to https://api.telegram.org/bot<api_token_bot>/getUpdates, replace <api_token_bot> with the API Token as received from BotFather.
Field "id" is the ChatID to be used in the script. Refer this link for more: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41664810/how-can-i-send-a-message-to-someone-with-my-telegram-bot-using-their-username


Once these are setup, make sure you have following libraries installed in your python installation: 

1. Requests 
2. Datetime
3. Json
4. Schedule (if there is no task scheduler in your local system)


That's it. Once this is done, you are all set to go.
